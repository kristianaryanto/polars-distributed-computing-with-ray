## Introduction

Polars is a blazingly fast DataFrame library implemented in Rust and has Python bindings. Ray is a distributed computing framework for Python that enables parallel and distributed computing.

This project demonstrates how to leverage the power of Polars in a distributed computing environment using Ray. Whether you have large-scale data processing tasks or need to distribute computations across a cluster, this integration provides a scalable solution.

## Getting Started


### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- for Polars
- Ray (install via `pip install ray`)

### Installation

```pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Usage
